	<h1>Health benefits of road runners</h1>
	
	<p>
	In recent years there has been a shift in urban dwellers chicken preferences. Road runners are becoming the preferred type of chicken due to their percieved health benefits.
	</p>
	<p>
	Many people believe that road runners habour no uknown diseases as they grow naturally.This has been also driven by medical information available about broiler meat that indicates it as a health risk.This has led  many people  shifting from broiler to road runner meat.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	A road runner takes about 12 months to reach full maturity while eating healthier natural foods. Unlike broilers which are fed chemically formulated feed runners scavenge for food eating a natural selection that nature provides. This includes insects,worms,vegetables and it is a known fact that vegetables are good and healthy option for growth.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	When it comes to disease prevention traditionally road runners have been dosed natural herbs and other stuff like ash. These tend to have no effect on the health of humans who later consume the chickens. When compared to broilers which are dosed chemically formulated medicines road runners seem a much healthier option.
