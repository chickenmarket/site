	<h1>What are free range chickens</h1>
	
	<p>
	This is a type of fowl which is descended from the red jungle fowl and is usually kept in a domestic environment.
	</p>
	<p>
 There are more of these in the world than any other bird or fowl with a population of above 19 billion.
	</p>
	<p>
	Humans mainly keep them for their meat and eggs. However they are kept for many other purposes such as cock fighting,as pets and many more.

	<p>Also known as road runners in Zimbabwe free range or native chickens where traditionally kept in the rural areas,but in recent years urban dwellers have started venturing into this domain.</p>
	<p>
	Road runners as their name implies like little detectives investigate the open pasture searching for food. Unlike broilers which are kept indoors and fed, these get 70 percent of their food requirements from foraging in the open field.
	</p>
	<p>
	Like with all livestock <a href = "chickenmaintenance.html">road runner care and maintenance</a> is a very important part of raising these types of poultry. This activity will consume considerable time and resources and should be taken seriously for best results.
