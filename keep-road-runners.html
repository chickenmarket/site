	<h1>How to keep and care for road runners</h1>
	
	<p>
	Are you planning to <strong>keep road runner chicken</strong>?Are you trying to <strong>learn</strong> how to <strong>care for road runners</strong>? If you answered yes to these questions then read on.<br><br>
	When keeping <strong>road runner chicken</strong> there are certain basic requirements to be considered.
	</p>
	<p>
	If you start with just hatched chicks it is probably best to let them remain under the care of mother hen. The hen will provide them with the warmth they will need during the first three weeks as well as teach them how to forage for food. These are incapable of regulating their body temperature during this period and depend on external heat sources.
	   </p>
	   <p>
	   Their safety must be taken into account as they are incapable of self defence. It is best to keep both the hen and chicks in a secure area away from predators until they are grown.

	   <p>
	   If they are store bought day olds then a <a href="chickbrooder.html">chick brooder</a> is required. This will provide a place of warmth and safety just like a mother hen will do.
	   </p>
	   <p>
	   Grown chickens also need a place of safety at night,during bad weather which can keep predators at bay and a place to forage during the day. These two requirements are dependent on the number to be kept.Generally the more  the bigger the space required. Plan for 0.1 square metres space for each chicken inside the coop and more for free ranging.
	   </p>
	   <p>
	   Inside the coop provide water drinkers, feeders and places to perch for the birds. The more the birds the more of the should be made available. 
	   </p>
	   <p>
	   The coop must be cleaned and sprayed regularly to prevent <a href="https://www.poultryhub.org/show-poultry-handbook/diseases/">diseases that affect chicken</a>.
