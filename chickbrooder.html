	 <p>
	 A brooder should have round walls to discourage chicks from piling together. If corners exist they tend to crowd and pile on them leading to suffocation and death of the chicks at the bottom of the pile.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 An infrared lamp should be used as a heat source and the must be constant and should be placed above the chicks during the first week. Increase the heigth of the lamp by each week after that until the chicks can regulate their body temperature, usually after 3 weeks.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 Hot water bottles and other heat sources can be used in case of emergency or in areas with no electricity.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 A chick feeder and a waterer must be placed in the brooder as well. The water openings must br small enough to enable chicks to drink yet prevent them from drowning and splashing in the water.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 At the bottom bedding of dry straw or wood shavings must be provided. This should be changed regularly when wet.
