	 <p>
	 A brooder should have round walls to discourage chicks from piling together. If corners exist they tend to crowd and pile on them leading to suffocation and death of those at the bottom of the pile.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 A 250 watt infrared lamp should be used as a heat source and the must be constant. It is recommended that it should be placed either 45 to 50 centimetres in cold areas or 60 to 68 centimetres in warm areas above the brooder during the first week. Increase the height of the lamp from the brooder each week after that until the chicks can regulate their body temperature, usually after four weeks.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 If the lamp is too close to the chicks they will show this by escaping to the brooder edges. If its too far they will huddle under the lamp. It should be adjusted such that the birds show freedom of movement as they feed.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 Hot water bottles and other heat sources can be used in case of emergency or in areas with no electricity.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 A chick feeder and a waterer must be placed in the brooder as well. The water openings must br small enough to enable chicks to drink yet prevent them from drowning and splashing in the water.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 At the bottom bedding of dry straw or wood shavings must be provided. This should be changed regularly when wet.
